# Project Ideas

1. DnD Inventory Manager
    - Users log in and can see a list of their characters
    - Each character has a grid displaying their current inventory as images of items superimposed over the grid
    - Next to the inventory grid is an item sidebar. Users can click and drag items from this sidebar and into the inventory grid.
    - Additional features if I have time to implement
    - Hovering over an item gives its name and brief description. Clicking on it pulls up details on the item
    - Users can add and delete as many characters as they need
    - Item name, image, weight, description, etc are all accessible through a custom API
2. YouTube playlist manager. Use https://developers.google.com/youtube/?ref=apilist.fun to create a custom youtube playlist implementation
3. Almanac. Pulls from historical data APIs from https://apilist.fun/ to display sport and/or weather data from specified date and/or date range
